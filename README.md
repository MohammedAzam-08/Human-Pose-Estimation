# 🧍‍♂️ Human Pose Estimation Using OpenCV & TensorFlow

A Python-based project for real-time human pose detection in images and videos using **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **pre-trained deep learning models**. The system identifies and visualizes key human body landmarks and provides real-time visual feedback for both static and motion input.

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a practical implementation of **human pose estimation** using a combination of **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It can:
- Detect multiple body joints (elbows, knees, shoulders, etc.)
- Draw skeletal lines connecting key points
- Process both images and video streams (including webcam or files)
- Save annotated output for further use or research

## 📌 Key Features

- 🖼️ Upload static images for pose detection
- 🎞️ Process video files for real-time frame-by-frame pose estimation
- 🎯 Adjustable threshold for detection accuracy
- 💾 Output with detected landmarks saved as image or video
- 🧠 Powered by TensorFlow's pose estimation model and OpenCV

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Ensure Python (≥3.7) is installed. Then, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammedAzam-08/Human-Pose-Estimation.git
cd Human-Pose-Estimation
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
🚀 Usage Guide
▶️ Image-Based Pose Estimation
bash
Copy
Edit
python estimation_app.py
Upload a static image (e.g., run.jpg)

Output saved as: OutPut-image.png

🎥 Video-Based Pose Estimation
bash
Copy
Edit
python pose_estimation_Video.py
You’ll be prompted to enter the path to a video file (e.g., run1.mp4)

Annotated video output will be saved locally

🧪 Testing & Results
The pose detection has been tested on:

Multiple poses and light conditions

Static and moving backgrounds

High-resolution and low-resolution media

✅ Visual accuracy and performance vary slightly based on model input and lighting conditions.

### ✅ Final To-Dos:
- Replace any placeholder images if needed (like `run.jpg`, `pose-gif.gif`).
- Consider uploading a **YouTube video demo** and linking it.
- If using **Streamlit**, describe the UI experience briefly or add screenshots.

Would you like me to now do the same for your **`Waste-Management-System`** or **`Examify`** project?
