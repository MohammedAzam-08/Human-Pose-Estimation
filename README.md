# Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

## Description
This project utilizes OpenCV and Streamlit to perform human pose estimation from images and videos. It detects key body parts and visualizes the pose on the uploaded images or video frames.

## Key Features
- Upload an image for pose estimation.
- Process video files for real-time pose estimation.
- Visual representation of detected body parts and their connections.
- Adjustable threshold for detecting key points.
- Output images with estimated poses saved for further use.

## Installation
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
- For image processing, run `estimation_app.py` and upload an image.
- For video processing, run `pose_estimation_Video.py` and provide a video file.

## Output
- The processed images will be saved as `OutPut-image.png`.
